## Introduction

In this second part of the project, we will focus on implementing persistent storage and validations for user-entered data. We will explore how React and Vite enable us to handle these functionalities efficiently.

## Next Step

The immediate next step in the project development is to define the foundational architecture and set up the development environment. This includes:

- Establishing the project structure (scaffolding) to organize the code efficiently.
- Installing necessary dependencies, such as libraries for state management or validations.
- Configuring development tools, including linters, formatters, and automation scripts.

With these foundations in place, the project will be ready to progress toward implementing key features.
